This is a project that I completed as part of the Supervised Learning course, as part of the MS-DS program thorugh the University of Colorado Boulder.  Throughout the course, I tried several machine learning techniques to predict points per game (PPG) for NFL player in Fantasy Football, using various features involving the player's individual statistics and team statistics.  Each model gave results similar to a simple linear regression model on average draft position (ADP). The main noticable difference was the that other models gave higher predicted PPG early in the draft.  So, I decided that a polynomial regression model would be a better option given the results of the more complicated models. Due to changes in postional value in the fantasy football community and slightly better correlation that ADP, positional ranking was used as the only model feature.  By limiting the model feature to just positional rank, I was able to pull data going back to 2017.  Additional features requried significant data cleaning that was not possible in the time-frame of the project. This model does not help identify under-valued or over-valued players. But, it is useful for estimating the PPG for each player, given where the public is drafting them.  This can be helpful to group together similar valued players, by predicted PPG, and potentially improve draft strategy.
